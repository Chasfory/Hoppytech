# Hoppytech
Small personal project not finished on the mascot of EPITECH who is called Hoppy (it's a pretty cat who walks around the school :)).  

This allowed me to discover the web and give me skills in new languages ​​for my 2nd year internship research, my goal was to create a kind of social network for students to post images of Hoppy and that they can communicate with each other to talk about the latter.  
I will see if in the future I finish this project.  
- Frontend made in JavaScript  
- Backend made in TypeScript
